# pandas-challenge
The panda's challenges require  to perform an empirical analysis after being appointed-
the new Chief Data Scientist for your city's school district. 
In this capacity, I must help the school board and mayor make strategic -
decisions about future school budgets and priorities.

As a first task,
I am asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results.
Access will be granted to every student's math and reading scores, 
as well as various information on the schools they attend. 
I need to aggregate the data to showcase evident trends in school performance.
To perform this analysis, I used Pandas and Jupyter Notebooks to create a report that included the following data:
Could you perform the necessary calculations and create a high-level 
snapshot of the district's critical metrics in a data frame?
Include the following: Total number of unique schools, Total students, Total budget, Average math score
Average reading score,% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)

As for the School Summary
I must perform the necessary calculations and then create a data frame-
that summarizes critical metrics about each school?
Include the following:School name,School type,Total Students,Total school budget,Per student budget
Average math score,Average reading score,% passing math (the percentage of students who passed math)
% passing reading (the percentage of students who passed reading)
% overall passing (the percentage of students who passed math AND reading)
